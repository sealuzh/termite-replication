# Generating Higher-Quality Tests through Focus Optimization

The content of this replication package is the following.
We provide:

* [here](https://github.com/sealuzh/termite-replication/tree/master/tests) the test suites generated with our prototype tool used for the conducted studies;
* [here](https://github.com/sealuzh/termite-replication/tree/master/scripts) the scripts we used to generate the tests;
* [here](https://github.com/sealuzh/termite-replication/tree/master/source) the complete source code of our implementation. Note that this project contains part of the API used to compute the quality metrics that we obtained from the original authors of the paper _Automatic Test Case Generation: What If Test Code Quality Matters?_
* [rq0](https://github.com/sealuzh/termite-replication/tree/master/rq0) contains the tests we manually labeled, as well the outcome of such manual labeling.

**NOTE**: in this replication package, we refer to _TERMite_ with the _rmosa_ name.
